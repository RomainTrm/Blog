Hi! My name is Romain BERTHON. Welcome to my personal tech blog.

![Portrait of me](1.jfif)

I'm working as a professional software developer since I graduated in 2014. My main experience is on the *back end* side, but I also have some experience on the *UI* side, first with desktop clients (*Windows Form*, *WPF* then *UWP*) and now with web clients.  

Early in my career, I've been introduced to craft practices and techniques like *TDD*, *BDD*, *DDD* or *Extreme-Programming*. I'm using them on a daily basis. I also share about them on this blog and at community events like conferences and local meetups.  

### ABOUT THIS BLOG

Over the years, I've accumulated a lot of experience on various topics. I try to write about topics where I think my experience is valuable enough to be shared (with you and the future self). I also regroup talks that I gave at conferences.  

I've decided to write all my new posts in English. However, I had another blog where I was used to publishing in French. As I have retrieved my old articles here, you will find content in French and English in this blog.
