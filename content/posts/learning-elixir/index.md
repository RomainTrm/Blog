In a previous [post](../using-processes-for-better-resilience/), I've mentioned I've read the book [Programming Elixir 1.6](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/).  

Recently, because I was planing to read [Real-World Event Sourcing](https://pragprog.com/titles/khpes/real-world-event-sourcing/), I chose to conduct a second reading because my limited knowledge and skills with Elixir were eroded over time. I took time to take many notes wich are available on a dedicated [repository](https://github.com/RomainTrm/Book-ElixirExercices).  

In this post, I want to present to you the Elixir langage, the Erlang VM and give you a taste of why you should learn it even if you will not going use it in production.

- langage:  
  - ruby syntax
  - FP
  - types (dynamic typing & static analysis)
  - atoms
  - homoconoicity
- BEAM:  
  - nodes
  - actor model
  - hot-upgrade
- OTP:
  - Server
  - Supervisor
